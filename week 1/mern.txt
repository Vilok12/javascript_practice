==>  all primitive elements(number,string etc) are immutable (cannot change or modify)  ex:- let a=10; a=a+1; a=a*10; here first a is allocated for 10 then it got modified to 11 so it gets new memory location for 11 and a is allocated for it and 10 stays till completion of excecution and 110 is made for a and 11 stays in memory and 10,11 are removed from memory after excecution completion
==>  all reference types(non primitive elements) are mutable
