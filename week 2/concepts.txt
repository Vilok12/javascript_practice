in javascript we cannot perform multi threading , javascript is single threaded
a thread can do 1 task at a time
frequent asynchronous operations in node js:  file system operations ,http requests ,database operations , timers , crytographic operations
browser javascript runtime=javascript engine + web api + event loop
node js javascript runtime =javascript engine + node js api + event loop 
all the loops in javascript runs synchronously         
every statements and the code is excecuted by js engine only even in asynchronous also 
set timeout function makes the call back function to call it back after mentioned seconds and excecutes after that time it stays in node js api 
asynchronous is used to save the time delay as the statement that need less time to excecute if it is called afterwards it should wait a long time

-> js engine sends settimeout function to node js api                                            node js api
js engine                                                                                        -> node js api send callback function  to event loop   
                        
-> after that time call back function is called back and get excecuted                           event loop
                                                                                                 ->event loop send callback function after that mentioned time to js engine

synchronous blocking : a blocking statement that takes time to excecute
synchronous non blocking : it does not block it is excecuted fastly
asynchronous blocking : a non blocking statementthat takes time to excecute
asynchronous non blocking  :  it does not block it is excecuted fastly

The JavaScript engine starts executing the code line by line.

When it encounters setTimeout, it does not wait.

The setTimeout callback is sent to Web APIs / Node.js APIs along with the timer.

After the timer finishes, the callback is placed into the Callback Queue.

The Event Loop keeps checking:

Is the Call Stack empty?

If yes, the Event Loop moves the callback from the queue to the Call Stack.

The JavaScript engine executes the callback function.

(setTimeout) is used to keep a timeout period for that particular statement and then excecuted after that time

(setInterval) is used to excecute continously mainly used in stopwatches and timers ->  setInterval(()=>{ })

=====>>> Twilio api -> used for sms,video calls etc 

(promise) is created if it is fullfilled , (then) statement is called and if it rejected , (catch) statement is called
